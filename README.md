## 📌 **1. Introduction**
This project analyzes PAOK FC player performance by collecting, processing, and visualizing data from the official PAOK FC website. The analysis was conducted in two phases:
1. **Python** for initial exploration and visualizations.
2. **Power BI** for advanced insights and interactive dashboards.

---

## 🔍 **2. Data Collection**
Data was web-scraped using Python’s Beautiful Soup library. The dataset includes statistics such as goals, assists, accuracy, defensive actions, and minutes played. After cleaning and verifying the data, it was exported to `.xlsx` format for Power BI analysis.

### **Code Snippet (Data Gathering)**:
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = "https://www.paokfc.gr"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Example: Extracting player stats
players = soup.find_all('div', class_='player-stat')
```

# 📊 3. Analysis in Jupyter Notebook

The data was analyzed using Pandas and Matplotlib. Key visualizations include:

- **Top 10 Scorers**: Bar chart of players with the highest goals scored.
- **Accuracy Analysis**: Scatter plot comparing shots to accuracy rates.
- **Defensive Actions**: Double y-axis graph for steals and yellow cards.

### **Challenges**:
- Anomalies in data (e.g., Tomasz Kedziora with 93 attempts).
- Ensuring consistency across datasets.

# 🛠️ 4. Data Export for Power BI

The cleaned data was exported using `df.to_excel()` and imported into Power BI for further analysis.
